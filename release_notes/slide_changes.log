src/slide/write_ligand_mol2.c
Print the version number of SLIDE in the comment header

src/slide/basics.c
src/slide/main.c
src/slide/err_handle.c
Added slide_fopen.  This function prints out a useful comment to stderr if
the file could not be opened.

src/slide/err_handle.c
The functions now check the return value of fopen -- they should have been
doing this all along.

src/slide/read_pdb.c
OXT did not have a correct hydro value assigned (was 0); this has been changed
to the default O value of 530.  A better place to change this would be 
inc/hydro.h, but it is very easy to mess up the columns and would require
an entry for each residue.

Numerous modifications to condense the code but keep the scoring and docking
results exactly the same as SLIDE 3.0.2.  One of the main objectives is to
attempt to extricate slide from the global structure.  The advantage is
code reuse (1 function can serve multiple purposes in many cases--that is 
if we can generalize ideas, we don't need a function for water hbonds, a
function for protein hbonds, a function for ligand hbonds, etc. but only 1
function for hbonds).  Additional advantages are saving multiple top scoring
dockings in memory is easier, and it is easier to extend and debug the
SLIDE code base. 

Added:
src/slide/distance_array.c
src/slide/inc/distance_array.h
Modified:
src/slide/main.c
src/slide/main_score.c
src/slide/bump_check.c
src/slide/unbump_side_chains.c
Divides the protein space into overlapping cubes (bins).  Each bin is currently
4.0 (A) cubed and contains all protein atoms in the cube with the same center
as the bin with side length 4.0 + 5.0 + 5.0 = 14.0 (A) cubed.  Currently, this
is restricted to distance calculations before sidechain rotation (of protein
and/or ligand).  This has helped reduce the computational cost of checking
for anchor bumping, initial buried carbon check, and initialization of the
inter protein-ligand squared distances matrix.

Most important change in terms of computational speed:
src/slide/inc/dist_funs.h
many other source files
Added an inline function to compute the square of the distance between two
3D points.  Replaced tolerances with squared tolerances and delayed computation
of sqrt() till it is needed for computation.

src/slide/main_score.c
src/slide/bump_check.c
src/slide/match_triangles.c
src/slide/score_complex.c
inc/defs.h
Added inc/atom.h
the required header file changes
Modified slide_score to use popt for commandline options and allow 
slide_score to work as done previously (i.e. no flags for prot lig scoring if
scripts expect this functionality).  Added the ability to create a table
of protein hydrogen bonding atoms and protein hydrophobic sidechains 
that made favorable interactions with 1 or more ligands.  In this table 
each row (matchprint) represents the protein interactions satisifed by that
particular ligand.

src/slide/bump_check.c
src/slide/find_all_bumps.c
changed bump handling of metals so now any ligand atom can be as close as MIN_METAL_{1/2}_HBOND_LENGTH to a metal (previously only ACCEPTOR & DONEPTOR could)

src/slide/inc/vdwrad.h
Metal vdw radii no longer matter with the above changes

src/slide/main.c
changed version number to 3.0.2
