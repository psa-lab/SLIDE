 *  has to be only done once per database. Markings for all atoms are
 *  stored in an array 'mark', the entries have the following meanings:
 *   -2   no carbon, ignore this atom during the search
 *   -1   carbon already included in a cycle
 *   0    an unvisited carbon or carbon not included in a cycle yet
 *  The reason for distinguishing between the last two cases is that
 *  a search will never start with an atom that is already included in 
 *  another ring to prevent identifying the same ring more than once.
