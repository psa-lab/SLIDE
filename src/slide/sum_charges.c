/* This script pre-process the ligands file before they are inputted to any scoring function.
   Charges are assigned to atoms by QuACPAK, a program from OPENEYE before we run SLIDE. We
   need to merge the charges of heavy atoms and charges of their relative neighbors so that
   the correct charges will be used in the measurement of salt-bridges.
   
   1. Sum charges of all H neighbors to heavy atoms (non-H atoms) and record
      the new charges in "charge_sum" entry.
   2. Sum charges of all non-H neighbors to atom N or O. If there is only 1 
      direct non_H neighbor, we need to sum up charges on the 2nd layer neighbors;
      otherwise just sum charges of all 1st layer neighbor.
      
      If an atom only has C neighbors and these C neighbors have other N or O 
      neighbors, sum also the charges of their N or O neighbors.
